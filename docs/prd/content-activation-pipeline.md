# PRD: Content Activation Pipeline

> **Priority**: P1 — High
> **Publisher Prefix**: `cap_`
> **Solution Name**: ContentActivationPipeline

## Overview

Build an AI-augmented content scaling pipeline that transforms raw ideas (voice notes, text messages, forwarded content) into multi-platform social media posts with human approval gates. The system captures ideas from Microsoft Teams, generates platform-optimized content using Azure OpenAI, routes through an approval workflow, and publishes to LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Teams, Email, and Blog platforms automatically.

Inspired by the "record once, publish everywhere" content scaling pattern — but built entirely on Microsoft first-party tools (Power Platform, Azure AI, Teams, SharePoint).

## User Stories

### Content Creator
- As a content creator, I want to post a quick idea in a Teams channel (text, voice note, or forwarded message), so that it automatically becomes multi-platform content
- As a content creator, I want AI to generate platform-optimized versions of my idea (LinkedIn post, X thread, blog draft, email blurb, Teams announcement), so that I don't have to manually rewrite for each platform
- As a content creator, I want AI-generated images that match my brand guidelines, so that every post has a professional visual
- As a content creator, I want to see a dashboard of all my content in various pipeline stages, so that I can track what's pending, approved, and published

### Content Approver
- As a content approver, I want to review generated content via an Adaptive Card in Teams, so that I can approve, request edits, or reject without leaving Teams
- As a content approver, I want to see the original idea alongside the generated content, so that I can verify accuracy and tone
- As a content approver, I want approval requests to expire after 48 hours with a 24-hour reminder, so that content doesn't get stuck

### Platform Admin
- As a platform admin, I want to configure which platforms are enabled and their posting parameters, so that I can control where content gets published
- As a platform admin, I want to see publishing logs with success/failure details, so that I can troubleshoot failed posts
- As a platform admin, I want rate limit management and retry logic, so that publishing doesn't fail due to API throttling

## Architecture — 6-Layer Pipeline

```
Layer 1: CAPTURE         Teams channel → new message → trigger flow
Layer 2: TRANSCRIBE      Voice → Azure AI Speech → text transcript
Layer 3: GENERATE         Text → Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) → platform-specific content
                          Text → Azure OpenAI (DALL-E 3) → brand-consistent images
Layer 4: REVIEW           Adaptive Card approval in Teams → approve/edit/reject
Layer 5: PUBLISH          Scheduled Power Automate flows → platform connectors
Layer 6: MONITOR          Power BI dashboard → pipeline metrics + engagement analytics
```

## App Screens (React Code App — Fluent UI v9)

The management UI is a Power Apps Code App (React SPA hosted on Power Platform):

1. **Dashboard** — Pipeline stats (total ideas, pending review, approved, published, failed, this week), recent activity feed
2. **Ideas** — Searchable/filterable list of all content ideas with status badges and source type icons
3. **Review** — Approval queue showing content pieces pending review, with inline approve/reject/edit actions
4. **Schedule** — Calendar-style view of scheduled and published content across platforms
5. **Platforms** — Configuration cards for each platform (enable/disable, connector settings, prompt templates)
6. **History** — Published content log with links to live posts, success/failure status, and engagement metrics

## Automations (5 Cloud Flows)

### Flow 01: Capture & Transcribe
- **Trigger**: When a new message is posted in "Content Ideas" Teams channel
- **Actions**: Detect source type → extract audio if voice → Azure AI Speech transcription → create cap_ContentIdea record → archive media to SharePoint
- **Error handling**: If transcription fails, set status to Failed with error details

### Flow 02: Generate Content
- **Trigger**: When cap_ContentIdea status changes to "Transcribed" or "Text Input"
- **Actions**: For each enabled platform → call Azure OpenAI with platform-specific prompt → create cap_ContentPiece records → update idea status to "Generated"
- **Parallelism**: All platform generations run in parallel branches

### Flow 03: Generate Images
- **Trigger**: When cap_ContentIdea status changes to "Generated" AND generateimages = true
- **Actions**: For each content piece → generate DALL-E prompt from content → call DALL-E 3 → save image to SharePoint → create cap_MediaAsset record → update idea status to "InReview"

### Flow 04: Approval Workflow
- **Trigger**: When cap_ContentIdea status changes to "InReview"
- **Actions**: Build Adaptive Card with all generated content + images → post to "Content Approvals" Teams channel → wait for response → update piece statuses based on approval action
- **SLA**: 48-hour expiry with 24-hour reminder

### Flow 05: Publish Content
- **Trigger**: Recurrence (every 15 minutes)
- **Actions**: Query approved pieces where ScheduledDate ≤ now → post to each platform via connectors → create cap_PublishLog records → update status to Published or Failed
- **Retry**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff, then mark Failed

## Platform Connectors

| Platform | Connector | Image Size | Max Length | Hashtag Strategy |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|------------------|

| X/Twitter | X connector (BYOA) | 1200×675 | 280 chars/tweet, 4-8 tweet threads | Inline (3 max) |
| Blog | HTTP connector | N/A | 800-1,500 words | None |
| Email | Office 365 Outlook | N/A | 200 words | None |
| Teams | Teams connector | N/A | 500 chars | None |

## AI Prompt Templates

Six prompt templates are included in `src/prompts/`:
- `linkedin-post.md` — Professional thought leadership posts
- `x-twitter-thread.md` — Punchy threads (≤280 char per tweet)

## Copilot Studio Agent

- **Content Pipeline Helper** — conversational agent that answers:
  - "What's the status of my latest idea?"
  - "How many posts are pending review?"
  - "Show me this week's published content"
  - "Submit a new content idea: [text]"
  - Uses Dataverse queries to retrieve pipeline data

## Power BI Dashboard

- Pipeline throughput funnel (Ideas → Generated → Approved → Published)
- Content velocity (ideas/week, posts/week trend line)
- Approval turnaround time (avg hours from generation to approval)
- Platform distribution (posts per platform, pie chart)
- Failure rate (rejected + failed / total, with error category breakdown)
- KPIs: Total ideas, Approval rate, Avg time-to-publish, Active platforms

## Azure Resource Requirements

- **Azure OpenAI**: GPT-4o deployment + DALL-E 3 deployment
- **Azure AI Speech**: Speech-to-Text REST API v3.2
- Both should use managed identity or service principal (no API keys in flows)
