# Operational Runbook: Agent-Driven Power Platform Development

## Quick Start

### One-Time Setup

#### 1. Enable Copilot Coding Agent
1. Go to **github.com/settings/copilot** → **Coding agent**
2. Enable "Copilot coding agent" policy
3. Under Repository access, select **All repositories** or add `cat-tools-activate-pipeline`
4. Verify: Open any issue and check if `copilot` appears in the assignee dropdown

> **Requires**: Copilot Pro+ subscription (or Copilot Business/Enterprise via org)

#### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
Go to **github.com/denise-msft/cat-tools-activate-pipeline/settings/secrets/actions** and add:

| Secret | Description | Where to get it |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `PP_CLIENT_ID` | Service Principal App ID | Azure Portal → App Registrations |
| `PP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Service Principal secret | Azure Portal → App Registrations → Certificates & Secrets |
| `PP_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD Tenant ID | Azure Portal → Entra ID → Overview |
| `PP_DEV_ENV_URL` | Dev environment URL | `https://org-dev.crm.dynamics.com` |
| `PP_DEV_ENV_ID` | Dev environment ID | Power Platform Admin Center → Environments |
| `PP_STAGING_ENV_URL` | Staging env URL | Same pattern |
| `PP_PROD_ENV_URL` | Production env URL | Same pattern |

#### 3. Create Service Principal
```bash
# Create app registration
az ad app create --display-name "CAT Tools Pipeline SP"

# Create service principal
az ad sp create --id <app-id>

# Grant Dataverse permissions
# In Power Platform Admin Center: Add as System Administrator to each environment
```

#### 4. Register Solution Publisher
In your dev environment, create (or verify) the publisher:
- **Name**: CAT Tools
- **Prefix**: cat
- **Option Value Prefix**: 10000

## Daily Workflow

### Creating a New Feature (Full Automated Flow)

```
1. Write a PRD → Create issue with "PRD Feature" template
2. Label it: prd + decompose
3. ⚡ Plan & Review workflow fires:
   - Auto-decomposes PRD into child issues (schema, app, flow, agent, report, config, test)
   - Creates a "Plan Review" summary issue
   - Posts the plan on the original PRD issue
4. You review the plan:
   - Edit child issues (modify scope, acceptance criteria)
   - Add or remove issues as needed
   - When ready → add `plan-approved` label to the Plan Review issue
5. ⚡ Dispatch Agents workflow fires:
   - Wave 1 (schema) issues assigned to @copilot immediately
   - Wave 2-4 (app/flow/agent/report/config/test) queued with wave labels
6. Copilot creates branches, edits solution files, opens PRs
7. CI validates each PR:
   - Pack solution (pac solution pack)
   - Solution Checker (pac solution check)
   - Import to dev (pac solution import)
   - Playwright E2E tests (schema validation + Code App tests)
   - PAC Test Engine (canvas + MDA tests)
   - Results posted as PR comment + uploaded as artifacts
8. You review PRs and merge
9. Dev deploy runs automatically on merge to master
10. To dispatch next wave: add `dispatch-next-wave` label to Plan Review issue
```

### Creating a New Feature (Manual Flow)

```
1. Write a PRD → Create issue with "PRD Feature" template
2. Label it: prd + decompose
3. Agent (or you) decomposes into child issues
4. Assign child issues to @copilot (start with schema → app → flow)
5. Agent creates branches, edits solution files, opens PRs
6. CI validates each PR (pack, check, import, test)
7. You review PRs and merge
8. Dev deploy runs automatically on merge to main
```

### Fixing a Bug

```
1. Create issue with "Bug Fix" template
2. Describe the bug with repro steps
3. Assign to @copilot
4. Agent investigates, fixes, opens PR
5. Review and merge
```

### Deploying to Staging/Production

```
1. Go to Actions tab → "Deploy to Staging" workflow
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Type "deploy" to confirm → Packs managed solution → Imports to staging
4. For production: same flow, type "PRODUCTION" to confirm
```

## Issue Labels Reference

| Label | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `prd` | Product Requirements Documents |
| `decompose` | PRD needs to be broken into work items |
| `plan-review` | Auto-created plan review summary issue |
| `plan-approved` | Add to Plan Review issue to trigger agent dispatch |
| `auto-decomposed` | Auto-tagged on issues created by the plan workflow |
| `wave-2` / `wave-3` / `wave-4` | Queued execution waves |
| `dispatch-next-wave` | Add to Plan Review to dispatch next queued wave |
| `schema` | Dataverse table/column/relationship changes |
| `canvas-app` | Canvas Power App work |
| `model-app` | Model-driven app work |
| `cloud-flow` | Power Automate flow work |
| `copilot-agent` | Copilot Studio agent work |
| `power-bi` | Power BI report/dashboard work |
| `config` | Environment variables, connection references |
| `test` | Test plans and test cases |
| `bug` | Bug fixes |

## Agent Behavior

### What the agent CAN do:
- Edit solution XML/JSON/YAML files (Dataverse schema, forms, views)
- Create/modify Power Automate flow JSON
- Edit Canvas app YAML (unpacked format)
- Write Copilot Studio agent definitions
- Create Power BI TMDL and report JSON
- Write test plans (YAML + Power Fx)
- Run PAC CLI commands via MCP tools
- Create branches, commit, and open PRs

### What the agent CANNOT do (human needed):
- Complex Canvas app visual design (pixel-perfect layout)
- Live environment debugging
- Create service principals or manage Azure AD
- Approve production deployments
- Resolve merge conflicts in binary files

---

## Troubleshooting

### CI Pipeline fails on "Pack Solution"
- Check for XML syntax errors in Customizations.xml
- Verify all entity references in Solution.xml exist in Entities/ folder
- Ensure GUIDs are unique and properly formatted

### Agent doesn't pick up the issue
- Verify Copilot coding agent is enabled (Settings → Copilot → Coding agent)
- Check that the repo has coding agent access
- Ensure the issue is assigned to `copilot`, not just labeled

### Solution import fails in dev
- Check service principal has System Administrator role
- Verify environment URL in secrets matches actual env
- Check solution dependencies (missing tables, etc.)

### Tests fail
- Ensure app is published in the target environment
- Check Playwright browsers are installed in CI runner
- Verify test plan YAML references correct app logical name
